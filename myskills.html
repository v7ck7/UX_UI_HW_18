                <h4>Qualitative Interviews</h4>
                <p> approach qualitative interviews with a goal of gathering deep insights from a userâ€™s mindset. For instance, in a recent project, my team had the opportunity to interview a stakeholder. We collected valuable insights including the demographic of users on the website, what their main goals were, and how we can help those users accomplish those goals, as well as common problems users face.</p>
